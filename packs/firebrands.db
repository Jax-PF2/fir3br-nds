Attempt a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of the confluence, using your spell attack roll modifier. This attack ignores concealment granted by the confluence, and the elemental gets a +2 circumstance bonus on the spell attack roll against a target inside the confluence.

Make two Strikes, one with each of their two melee weapons, unarmed strikes or a combination of the two, each using the Captain Kaida's current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target. If the second Strike is made with a weapon that doesn't have the agile trait, it takes a –2 penalty. If both attacks hit, combine their damage, and then add any other applicable effects from both weapons. Any precision damage is only added once. Combine the damage from both Strikes and apply resistances and weaknesses only once. This counts as two attacks when calculating multiple attack penalty.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","label":"Double Slice 2nd Strike- Not Agile Weapon","selector":"attack","value":-2,"predicate":["none"]}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.835,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-04-11T21:02:44.548-04:00","version":{"schema":0.75,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.10.1"}}},"traits":{"value":["fighter"],"rarity":"common"},"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actions":{"value":2},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""},"deathNote":false},"ownership":{"default":0,"1oFmPw2UvAamgYrv":3,"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.10.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1681261362997,"modifiedTime":1681263515542,"lastModifiedBy":"aTWxsSrAlxp06IfB"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"CbcoxMQcn2i3ZVhs"},{"name":"Warped Hand","type":"action","effects":[],"system":{"description":{"gm":"","value":"<p>Captain Kaida makes a melee Strike with her mutated hand.
